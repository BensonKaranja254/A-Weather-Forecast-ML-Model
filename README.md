# Weather Forecast Prediction

Welcome to my GitHub repository featuring a Weather Forecast Prediction project! This Jupyter Notebook showcases my data science skills by building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether it will rain based on weather features. Using a dataset with 2,500 records of Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Cloud Cover, and Pressure, I developed a highly accurate model to forecast rain.

## Key Highlights
- **Data Exploration**: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas to verify data quality (no missing values) and summarize feature distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encoded the target variable (rain/no rain) using `LabelEncoder` for model compatibility.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree) using `GridSearchCV`, identifying the Decision Tree Classifier as optimal.
- **Machine Learning**: Trained a Decision Tree Classifier with scikit-learn, achieving a 99.87% test accuracy and near-perfect confusion matrix results (1 misclassification).
- **Visualization**: Visualized model performance with a confusion matrix heatmap using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, joblib (for model persistence).

This project demonstrates my ability to preprocess data, select and tune machine learning models, and evaluate performance effectively. Explore the notebook for the complete workflow, from EDA to model evaluation, and feel free to reach out for questions or collaboration opportunities!
